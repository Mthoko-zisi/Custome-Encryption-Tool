# Custome-Encryption-Tool
# 🔐 Python Encryption-Decryption Script

A simple yet powerful Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a randomized substitution cipher. Built as part of my cybersecurity learning journey.

## 🚀 Features
- Encrypt any text using a randomly shuffled character key
- Decrypt messages using the original encryption key
- Supports all printable characters: letters, digits, punctuation, and whitespace
- Demonstrates principles of symmetric encryption and key management

## 💡 How It Works
- A character set is built using Python's `string` module.
- A shuffled version of the character list acts as the encryption key.
- Each character in the input is substituted with the corresponding value from the shuffled key.
- The same key is used to reverse the process during decryption.

## 🧪 Example
Enter a message to encrypt: Hello, World! Encrypted message: J]%%b,E[b%4]6
